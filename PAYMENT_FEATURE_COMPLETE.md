## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

### Image Picker:

**Current Status:**
- Screen UI: ✅ Complete
- Integration: ⚠️ Placeholder only
- Requires: `react-native-image-picker` package

**To Enable Camera/Gallery:**
```bash
# Install package
npm install react-native-image-picker

# Add to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

# Link (if using React Native < 0.60)
react-native link react-native-image-picker
```

**Implementation Guide:**
```typescript
import {launchCamera, launchImageLibrary} from 'react-native-image-picker';

// Open camera
const openCamera = () => {
  launchCamera(
    {
      mediaType: 'photo',
      quality: 0.8,
      maxWidth: 1024,
      maxHeight: 1024,
    },
    (response) => {
      if (response.assets && response.assets[0]) {
        setSelectedImage(response.assets[0].uri);
      }
    }
  );
};

// Open gallery
const openGallery = () => {
  launchImageLibrary(
    {
      mediaType: 'photo',
      quality: 0.8,
      maxWidth: 1024,
      maxHeight: 1024,
    },
    (response) => {
      if (response.assets && response.assets[0]) {
        setSelectedImage(response.assets[0].uri);
      }
    }
  );
};
```

### Backend Requirements:

**API Endpoints Needed:**
```typescript
// Cancel booking
DELETE /api/bookings/:id
Response: { success: boolean, message: string }

// Upload payment proof
POST /api/payments/:bookingId/upload
Body: {
  method: 'BANK_TRANSFER' | 'QRIS',
  paymentProof: string
}
Response: { success: boolean, data: Payment }
```

**Already Available:** ✅ Both endpoints exist in backend
